The app should have two pages - one showing a list of videos and the other allowing a user to upload video file/s. Bonus points if you can stream/watch the videos and/or show thumbnails. The upload page should be at /upload and the list can either be on the homepage or a seperate page.
The server should handle video uploads, storing and retrieval of videos. These can simply be stored in the local file system (donâ€™t worry about data stores or databases!).
You can use Foundation or Bootstrap or another framework to help you for example. We expect the application to be fully responsive.
We are looking for a React SPA implementation with a data fetching framework.
